          Life in IQApex - we learnt how to build things from very basics to industrial level that can
          be used in the real world. Besides technical skills, we learnt how to work in a team and other 
          soft skills such as presenting your project, modeling it, and so on. Mr. Arjun Sir we found a great teacher, 
          mentor, and guide. His warmth is enough to motivate anyone to learn new skills. He always encourages us 
          to get out of one's comfort zone and try out new things.
